Today I am happy to introduce the new donation feature for all GitPress authors.

Follow the 3 steps to enable this feature:

1. Visit https://donate.cafe/ to register a Donate.Cafe account;
  - You need to install [Mixin Messenger](https://mixin.one/messenger) to receive donations.
2. Tap "Make Your Donate Button" to get your username at step 4;
3. Visit the [Dashboard of GitPress](https://gitpress.io/@me/dashboard/profile) and set your Donate.Cafe username at "Social" panel.

Once the setup is done, a Donate.Cafe icon will appear on your profile and people will also see a  donation button at the bottom of your posts.
